My take on the Home24 Go Challenge 

# Brief
Simple Web Application providing a simple form to input a URL of any webpage,
on submission the page returns with a bunch of insightful statistics on the 
entered webpage.
### Thats Why I named it: Webalayzer :D

# Running the project
1. Clone the project using Git
1. Make sure your Go version is 1.13+
1. Run `go get` on the top-level folder to make sure all dependencies are installed
1. Run `go run main.go`
1. The application should be running on "0.0.0.0:8080" and you can access it from any browser using "localhost:8080" or "127.0.0.1:8080"
